 Crop-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Overview:

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict crop prices based on historical data and various influencing factors. The goal is to create a reliable prediction system that can assist farmers, traders, and policymakers in making informed decisions regarding crop production, marketing, and distribution. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to improve the accuracy of price forecasts, thereby contributing to better planning and risk management in the agricultural sector.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw agricultural data for use in machine learning models.
Feature Engineering: Identifying and creating relevant features such as weather conditions, soil quality, market demand, and historical prices to improve prediction accuracy.
Model Development: Building and training various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
Model Evaluation: Comparing the performance of different models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Prediction Output: Generating predictions for future crop prices, with the ability to visualize trends and uncertainties.
Deployment: Setting up a framework to deploy the model for real-time or batch predictions.

Tools and Technologies:

Python: Core programming language used for data processing and model development.
Pandas and NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model building and evaluation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualization libraries for exploring data and presenting prediction results.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation of the project.

Usage:

For Data Analysis: Explore and understand the relationships between various factors and crop prices.
For Model Training: Train the machine learning model on historical data to predict future crop prices.
For Prediction: Use the trained model to forecast crop prices under different scenarios and conditions.
For Decision Support: Provide insights and recommendations for farmers, traders, and policymakers based on the prediction results.
